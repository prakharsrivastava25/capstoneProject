CROP MANAGEMENT

1. FIELD PREPARATION

 Plough twice with an iron plough and two to three times with cultivator and prepare the land to a fine tilth. 

2. APPLICATION OF FYM OR COMPOST

 Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost on the unploughed field. 

3. SEED TREATMENT WITH FUNGICIDES

 Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Thiram at 2 g/kg of seeds 24 hours before sowing.

4. FORMING BEDS AND CHANNEL

 Form beds of size 10 m2 or 20 m2. The irrigation channels are to be provided sufficiently.  

5. APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS
• Apply NPK fertilizer as per soil test recommendation as far as possible. If soil test recommendation is not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 80:40:40 NPK kg/ha. 
•Apply half of N and full dose of P2O and K2O5 basally before sowing and incorporate in the sowing line. 


SEED RATE: 100 kg/ha 

6. SOWING

 Draw the lines 20 cm apart and sow the seeds continuously after application of fertilizers to a depth of 5 cm. Avoid deep sowing. 

7. WEED MANAGEMENT
•Spray Isoproturon 800 g/ha as pre-emergence spraying 3 days after sowing followed by one hand weeding on 35th day after sowing.
•If herbicide is not applied, give two hand weedings on 20th and 35th day after sowing. 

8. WATER MANAGEMENT

 The crop requires 4 - 6 irrigations depending on the soil type and rainfall. Wheat crop requires minimum of 5 irrigations at the following critical stages.
             I – Immediately after sowing
             II – Crown root intiation : 15-20 DAS 
             III- Active tillering stage : 35-40 DAS
             IV- Flowering stage        : 50-55 DAS
             V- Grain filling stage      : 70-75 DAS
             Crown root initiation and flowering are the most critical stages. Water stagnation should be voided at the time of germination.

9. TOP DRESSING

 Apply remaining half of N at crown root initiation stage (15-20 DAS). 

10. HARVESTING

 Harvest the crop when the grains become hard and straw becomes dry and brittle. Trash and winnow the grains. Use mechanical threshers to reduce the cost of threshing and winnowing.


11. CROP PROTECTION 

Seed treatment: Treat the seed with any one of the following fungicides Carbendazim @ 2 g/kg of seed, Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed or Carboxin @ 2 g/kg of seed.

12. VALUE ADDITION IN WHEAT

Wheat is used principally for human consumption. It is converted into flour for the production of bread and other bakery products. It is used as “chapatti” (unleavened pan baked bread) in India. Wheat belongs to the genus Triticum and there are over 30,000 species and varieties. The principal wheats of commerce are the common or bread wheat (T.aestivum); macaroni wheat (T.durum) and club wheat (T.compactum).","JHARKAND","BOKARO","CHANDANKIYARI                                     ","2014-10-12 08:01:25.857"
