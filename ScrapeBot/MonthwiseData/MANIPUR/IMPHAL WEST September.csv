Sowing time- September-October.
 Seed treatment 
Treat the seeds with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g / kg or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/ kg and sow in lines spaced at 10 cm in raised nursery beds and cover with sand. Watering with rose can has to be done daily. Drench the nursery with Copper oxychloride @ 2.5 g/l of water at 15 days interval against damping off disease. Apply Carbofuran 3 G at 10 g/sq.m. at sowing.
Field preparation -
Thoroughly prepare the field with the addition of FYM @ 25 t/ ha and form ridges and furrows at a spacing of 60 cm. Apply 2 kg/ha of Azospirillum and 2 kg / ha of Phosphobacteria by mixing with 20 kg of FYM. Irrigate the furrows and transplant 40-45 days old seedlings, with the ball of earth on the ridges.
Spacing- 60*45 cm.
Manuring  
Basal dose : FYM 25 t/ha, NPK 30:60:30 kg/ ha. 
                    Potassium as K2SO4 for quality improvement. Application of potassium in the form of  potassium sulphate will increase quality of chilli. 
Top dressing : 30 kg N/ha in equal splits on 30, 60 and 90 days after planting.","MANIPUR","IMPHAL WEST","IMPHAL WEST II                                    ","2014-09-21 19:13:45.120"
"KHARIF","HORTICULTURE","Vegetables","Watermelon","Cultural Practices","Cultural practices in watermelon","Season
 Sow the seeds during November – December

Seed rate
 About 3.5 kg of seeds are required for a hectare.

Seed treatment
 Treat with Trichoderma viiridi 4 g or Pseudomonas fluorescens 10 g or Carbendizim 2g/kg of seeds

Preparation of field 
Plough the field to a fine tilth and form long channel 2.5 m apart.

Sowing
 Sow the seeds on one side of the channel with a spacing of 0.9 m between hills. Thin the seedlings 2/hill at 15 days after sowing. Sowing during January – February enables harvest during summer months and fetches higher price.

Irrigation 
Irrigate the field before dibbling the seeds and thereafter once a week. Irrigation should be given at regular intervals of time. Irrigation after a long dry spell results in cracking of fruits.

Application of fertilizers 
Apply FYM 20 t/ha, P 55 kg and K 55 kg as basal and N 55 kg/ha 30 days after sowing.Apply Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria @ 2 kg/ha and Pseudomonoas @ 2.5 kg/ha along with FYM 50 kg and neem cake 100 kg before last ploughing.
 
Nursery preparation: Nursery for watermelon can be prepared either with polythene bags of 200 gauge, 10 cm diameter and 15 cm height size or through protrays under protected nursery. In polybag nursery, fill the bags with 1:1:1 ratio of red soil, sand and farmyard manure mixture. Use protrays, each having 98 cells for raising seedlings. Transplant about 12 days old seedlings in the main field. 
Field preparation: Raise beds of 1.2 m width and 30cm height for sowing. 

Planting: Spread the lateral tubes in the centre of each bed. Irrigate the beds everyday. Spray pre-emergence weedicide (Pendimethalin @ 1 kg a.i/ha) just before planting. Plant the seedlings in the holes made at 60 cm distance.","MANIPUR","IMPHAL WEST","IMPHAL WEST II                                    ","2014-09-21 19:25:30.597"
