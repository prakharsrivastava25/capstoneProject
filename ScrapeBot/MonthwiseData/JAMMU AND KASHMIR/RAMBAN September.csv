with thatched roof and side walls are made up with bamboo sticks or wire mesh for good air circulation.
In North India, the sides are also covered with gunny cloth. Onions are stored in these sheds by
spreading them on dry and damp proof floor or racks. Periodical turning of bulbs or removal of rotten,
damaged and sprouted bulbs should be done. Well-ventilated improved storage structures with racks
or tiers having two or three layers of bulbs would be desirable for proper storage.","JAMMU AND KASHMIR","RAMBAN","BANIHAL                                           ","2014-09-22 13:02:06.800"
