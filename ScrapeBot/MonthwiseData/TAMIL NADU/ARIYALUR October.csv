Irrigate prior to harvest, if the soil is dry, as this will facilitate easy harvesting. If there is enough moisture in the soil, there is no need for irrigation for harvesting.
If water is not available for irrigating the field prior to harvest, work a mould board plough or work a country plough, so that the plants are uprooted.
