Apply 25 tonnes of FYM, 20 kg N, 30 kg P and 60 kg K/ha as basal and 20 kg N, 30 kg P and 60 kg K/ha on 45 days after planting.

After cultivation 
Weeding and earthing up should be done within 45 to 60 days after planting. Deep cultivation should be avoided. Small inefficient suckers from the mother plants have to be removed along with the second weeding. It requires profuse irrigation and shade.
Season
June â€“ July and February â€“ March are the suitable season for cultivation.

Planting material and seed rate
Cormels weighing about 20-25 g form good planting material. Seed rate of 800 kg/ha is required.

Preparation of field 
Plough the field to a fine tilth and form ridges and furrows at a spacing of 45 cm. In sandy loam soil, pit method is followed.","MADHYA PRADESH","WEST NIMAR(KHARGAON)","SEGAON                                            ","2014-09-28 12:08:55.473"
