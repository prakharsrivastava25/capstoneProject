For the optimum growth of mulberry and good sprouting of the buds, the mean atmospheric temperature should be in the range of 13oC to 37.7oC.  The ideal temperature should be between 24 and 28oC with relative humidity of 65 to 80 percent and sun shine duration of 5 to 12 hours per day.
            Mulberry can be grown in a rainfall range of 600mm to 2500mm.  Under low rainfall conditions, the growth is limited and requires supplemental irrigation.
